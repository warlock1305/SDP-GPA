# GitHub Profile Analyzer - Comprehensive Project Template

## INTRODUCTION

### Intro

The rising importance of open-source contributions has made GitHub profiles a central part of technical career evaluation. However, there is currently no standardized, objective method to assess the quality, diversity, and consistency of a GitHub user's public activity. Manual evaluation is time-consuming, subjective, and often fails to capture deeper aspects such as code structure, project complexity, and sustained contributions over time.

This project proposes a solution: a **GitHub Profile Analyzer powered by artificial intelligence** that combines multiple analysis approaches. The analyzer automatically fetches, processes, and evaluates a user's public repositories using:

1. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Analysis** - Structural code complexity assessment
2. **CodeBERT Semantic Embeddings** - Natural language understanding of code
3. **Machine Learning Classification** - Pattern recognition for architectural styles
4. **Multi-modal Feature Fusion** - Combining structural, semantic, and statistical features
5. **Significant Dimension Analysis** - Identifying key features that differentiate architectural patterns

The system generates comprehensive ratings and insights that reflect the user's technical breadth, depth, and activity history, going far beyond surface-level metrics like star counts or follower numbers.

### Literature Review

#### **Limitations of Popularity-Based Evaluation**

Borges et al. (2016), in their study "Understanding the Factors That Impact the Popularity of GitHub Repositories", investigated over 2,000 GitHub repositories to understand which elements contribute most significantly to popularity. They found that factors such as the programming language used, the domain of the project, and the type of repository (e.g., library vs. application) have measurable impacts on the number of stars and forks a project receives. However, their work reveals an important limitation: **popularity is not always an accurate proxy for quality or developer skill**. Many repositories achieve popularity through trendiness or visibility rather than technical complexity or code quality.

This insight supports the premise of our GitHub profile analyzer, which intentionally avoids using surface-level metrics like stars and forks to judge developer competence. Instead, our focus is on **semantic analysis of the code, structural organization of repositories, and the use of advanced technologies such as NLP and machine learning** to provide a more reliable and nuanced evaluation.

#### **Code Representation Using AST and Machine Learning**

Alon et al. (2019), in "Code2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Code", present a novel approach to representing source code by embedding its abstract syntax tree (AST) paths into vector space. By learning from the syntax and structure of the code, Code2Vec enables downstream tasks such as method name prediction and code classification. This technique is highly relevant to our project's **AST analysis component**, where we aim to semantically evaluate code snippets written by the user.

Our implementation extends this approach by using **ASTMiner** to extract structural features including:
- Path length and diversity metrics
- Node type distribution
- Nesting depth analysis
- Function and class complexity measures

#### **Semantic Code Understanding with CodeBERT**

Feng et al. (2020), in "CodeBERT: A Pre-Trained Model for Programming and Natural Languages", introduce a transformer-based language model trained on both code and natural language comments. CodeBERT supports multiple programming languages and can perform a wide range of tasks, including code summarization, documentation generation, and natural language querying of code. This **dual-modality makes it especially valuable** in aligning README content with actual implementation, enabling deeper insight into the congruence between documentation and source code.

In our system, CodeBERT assists in generating **contextual embeddings for both code and associated textual content**, improving the reliability of our semantic analysis and enabling cross-modal understanding between code structure and documentation quality.

#### **Multi-Modal Feature Fusion for Pattern Recognition**

Recent advances in **multi-modal learning** have shown that combining different types of features can significantly improve classification performance. Our approach follows this principle by fusing:

1. **Structural features** (AST metrics, file organization)
2. **Semantic features** (CodeBERT embeddings, keyword analysis)
3. **Statistical features** (complexity metrics, maintainability scores)
4. **Quality features** (documentation completeness, testing coverage)
5. **Significant dimensions** (key CodeBERT embedding dimensions that differentiate patterns)

This multi-modal approach enables our system to detect **29 different architectural patterns** including MVC, microservices, monolithic architectures, and educational project structures.

#### **Machine Learning for Architectural Pattern Detection**

Our system implements a **Random Forest classifier** that combines all extracted features to identify architectural patterns. This approach is supported by research showing that ensemble methods perform well on software engineering classification tasks, particularly when dealing with:

- **High-dimensional feature spaces** (912+ features in our case)
- **Non-linear relationships** between code characteristics and patterns
- **Small to huge-sized datasets** (122+ training repositories, expandable)
- **Multi-label classification** (repositories can exhibit multiple patterns)

The Random Forest approach provides **interpretable results** through feature importance ranking, enabling developers to understand which aspects of their code contribute most to pattern classification.

## METHODOLOGY

### **System Architecture Overview**

Our GitHub Profile Analyzer employs a **three-stage analysis pipeline**:

1. **Data Extraction Stage**: Repository cloning, file parsing, and metadata collection
2. **Feature Extraction Stage**: AST analysis, CodeBERT embeddings, and keyword extraction
3. **Analysis Stage**: Machine learning classification and quality assessment

## DECISION-MAKING AND PREDICTION PROCESSES

### **Architectural Pattern Detection Logic**

#### **1. Significant Dimension Analysis (Primary Method)**
Our system uses **pre-identified significant dimensions** from CodeBERT embeddings to differentiate between architectural patterns:

```python
def _analyze_category_scores_enhanced(self, features: Dict, semantic_analysis: Dict) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Enhanced category analysis using semantic analysis and CodeBERT embeddings."""
    
    # CLI vs Data Science differentiation
    cli_favored = [448, 720, 97, 39, 34]      # CLI-favored dimensions
    ds_favored = [644, 588, 540, 461, 657]     # Data science-favored dimensions
    
    # Web Application vs Library differentiation  
    web_favored = [588, 498, 363, 270, 155]   # Web-favored dimensions
    lib_favored = [720, 77, 688, 608, 670]    # Library-favored dimensions
    
    # Game Development vs Mobile App differentiation
    game_favored = [588, 85, 700, 82, 629]    # Game-favored dimensions
    mobile_favored = [77, 490, 528, 551, 354] # Mobile-favored dimensions
```

**Decision Criteria:**
- **High confidence (>0.8)**: Strong pattern match based on significant dimensions
- **Medium confidence (0.5-0.8)**: Moderate pattern match with some uncertainty
- **Low confidence (<0.5)**: Weak pattern match, fallback to keyword analysis

#### **2. Keyword-Based Pattern Recognition (Fallback Method)**
When semantic analysis is insufficient, the system falls back to keyword-based detection:

```python
# Fallback keyword analysis
category_scores = {
    'cli_tool': min(1.0, features.get('cli_keywords', 0) / 10.0),
    'data_science': min(1.0, features.get('data_science_keywords', 0) / 10.0),
    'web_application': min(1.0, features.get('web_keywords', 0) / 10.0),
    'library': min(1.0, features.get('library_keywords', 0) / 10.0),
    'game_development': min(1.0, features.get('game_keywords', 0) / 10.0),
    'mobile_app': min(1.0, features.get('mobile_keywords', 0) / 10.0),
    'educational': 0.0
}
```

**Keyword Categories:**
- **Framework**: React, Angular, Vue, Django, Flask, Express
- **Data Science**: ML, AI, neural networks, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Web Development**: HTTP, API, REST, frontend/backend
- **CLI Tools**: commands, terminal, arguments
- **Game Development**: games, graphics, animation
- **Mobile Development**: Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter

#### **3. Experience Level Assessment**
Experience level is determined through a **point-based scoring system**:

```python
def _assess_experience_level(self, features: Dict) -> str:
    points = 0
    
    # Code complexity (0-2 points)
    if features.get('complexity_score', 0) > 0.7:
        points += 2
    elif features.get('complexity_score', 0) > 0.4:
        points += 1
    
    # Project organization (0-2 points)
    if features.get('has_tests', False):
        points += 1
    if features.get('has_documentation', False):
        points += 1
    
    # Code structure (0-2 points)
    if features.get('class_count', 0) > 5:
        points += 1
    if features.get('function_count', 0) > 20:
        points += 1
    
    # Classification
    if points >= 6:
        return "Senior"
    elif points >= 3:
        return "Intermediate"
    else:
        return "Junior"
```

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- **Junior (0-2 points)**: Basic code structure, minimal organization
- **Intermediate (3-5 points)**: Moderate complexity, some testing/documentation
- **Senior (6+ points)**: High complexity, comprehensive organization, testing

#### **4. Quality Assessment Algorithm**
Quality scores are computed through **multi-dimensional evaluation**:

```python
def assess_code_quality(self, features: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Code Quality (30% weight)
    code_quality = (
        features.get('complexity_score', 0) * 0.4 +
        features.get('structure_score', 0) * 0.3 +
        features.get('consistency_score', 0) * 0.3
    )
    
    # Architecture Quality (25% weight)
    arch_quality = (
        features.get('modularity_score', 0) * 0.4 +
        features.get('abstraction_score', 0) * 0.3 +
        features.get('separation_score', 0) * 0.3
    )
    
    # Documentation Quality (25% weight)
    doc_quality = (
        features.get('readme_score', 0) * 0.5 +
        features.get('config_score', 0) * 0.3 +
        features.get('dependency_score', 0) * 0.2
    )
    
    # Maintainability (20% weight)
    maintainability = (
        features.get('test_coverage', 0) * 0.4 +
        features.get('organization_score', 0) * 0.3 +
        features.get('structure_clarity', 0) * 0.3
    )
    
    overall_score = (
        code_quality * 0.30 +
        arch_quality * 0.25 +
        doc_quality * 0.25 +
        maintainability * 0.20
    )
    
    return {
        'code_quality': code_quality,
        'architecture_quality': arch_quality,
        'documentation_quality': doc_quality,
        'maintainability': maintainability,
        'overall_quality': overall_score
    }
```

### **Prediction Confidence Calculation**

#### **Pattern Detection Confidence**
Confidence is calculated based on **multiple factors**:

```python
def calculate_pattern_confidence(self, category_scores: Dict, features: Dict) -> float:
    base_confidence = 0.0
    
    # Primary pattern confidence
    max_score = max(category_scores.values())
    base_confidence += max_score * 0.6
    
    # Supporting evidence
    if features.get('has_tests', False):
        base_confidence += 0.1
    if features.get('has_documentation', False):
        base_confidence += 0.1
    if features.get('has_ci_cd', False):
        base_confidence += 0.1
    
    # Semantic coherence
    if features.get('semantic_coherence', 0) > 0.7:
        base_confidence += 0.1
    
    return min(1.0, base_confidence)
```

**Confidence Factors:**
- **Pattern Score (60%)**: Primary architectural pattern match
- **Testing (10%)**: Presence of test files
- **Documentation (10%)**: README and configuration files
- **CI/CD (10%)**: Continuous integration setup
- **Semantic Coherence (10%)**: CodeBERT embedding consistency

    X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
    selected_features = selector.get_support()
